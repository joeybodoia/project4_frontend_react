# Frontend for project4

I utilized an API of songs and playlists that I created using Ruby on Rails to make a web application that hosts songs and playlists. I used React.js to create the frontend. 

create-react-app was used to create the frontend application. 

The application has full CRUD: You're able to create songs, read in song and playlist data, update songs, and delete songs.

Future changes I want to make: I would like to add more playlist functionality. I want the user to be able to add songs to a playlist on the web application, as well as create new playlists. I also want to create auth functionality and allow users to log in and create data specific to their account.
